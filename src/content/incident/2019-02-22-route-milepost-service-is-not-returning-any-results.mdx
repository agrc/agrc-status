import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

The LRS data in SGID was inadvertently deleted. This is causing the route/milepost service to not be able to find any matches.

<Update date="2019-02-22T14:06:18.000Z">
  The data has been replaced and the service is responding normally again.
</Update>
