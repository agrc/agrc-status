Five stations are down in the Reno, Nevada area which does not allow for a network solution.

- Incline Village
- Reno
- Yerington
- Geriach
- Fernley

Most users will have to use the MS\_ or single base connections. A resolution time is unknown. We will post updates as they become available.

<Update date="2023-04-18T13:30:00">
  The Fernley station is back online. This is still below the threshold for a network solution. Yerington received a new
  part that requires an install before coming back online.

<Update date="2023-04-20T09:20:00">
  The stations in the Reno area are back online. The Yerington (YER1) station is going through some setup and it will be
  back online shortly. That leaves the Geriach (GERL) station which is pretty far north and will only have an effect for
  those who work in far north areas.
</Update>

<Update date="2023-04-20T17:11:00">
  With only two stations down, customers are able to get a solution. We have decided to close this issue but will
  continue to post updates as the Yerington and Geriach stations come back online.
