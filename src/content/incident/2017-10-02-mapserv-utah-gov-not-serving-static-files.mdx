import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

**Cause**: The mapserv web server is not serving static content items (html, css, images). This affects a variety of other domains. This is caused by security software (OpenAM). A ticket has been created. We are waiting on resolution.

<Update date="2017-10-02T19:49:38-06:00">**Resolution**: The OpenAM client was patched.</Update>
