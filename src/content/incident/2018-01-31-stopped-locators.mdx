import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

Forklift updated the geocoding api locators and they did not restart properly. All geocoding is returning not found.

<Update date="2018-02-01T09:28:33.000Z">
  Restarting the server service removed the lock on the locators and they started up normally.
</Update>
