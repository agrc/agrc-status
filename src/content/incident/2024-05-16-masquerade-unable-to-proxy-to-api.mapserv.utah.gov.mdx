Masquerade requests are timing out when attempting to proxy requests to api.mapserv.utah.gov. This is causing most of the requests to fail. A ticket has been sent to the cloud core team.

This issue appeared at around 12:30 PM MDT today.

<Update date="2024-05-16T19:30:53.000Z">Restarting the masquerade service has solved the issue.</Update>
