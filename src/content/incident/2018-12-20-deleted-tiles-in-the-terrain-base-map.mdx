import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

Tiles outside of Salt Lake, Morgan and Weber counties were accidentally removed from the discover servers.

A suggested work-around would be to use the Lite base map.

We are working hard to generate new tiles. There's currently no ETA on when they will be completed.

<Update date="2018-12-21T12:15:00.000Z">
  All tiles in levels 0 through 16 have now been restored. Work continues on levels 17-19.
