import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

The clustered file system that is shared between the two servers that host the mapserv.utah.gov/arcgis/rest ArcGIS Server instance is down.

<Update date="2018-06-25T08:15:00.000Z">
  DTS hosting brought the clustered file system back online and ArcGIS Server has been restarted. Additional maintenance
  will be done this evening beginning at 5 PM. Expect periodic downtime beginning at that time.
