import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

The mapserv web server is not serving static content items (html, css, images, javascript) as well as a variety of other domains. This is caused by an outage with our hosting companies security software (OpenAM). They are aware of the issue and is working to resolve it.

<Update date="2017-09-11T09:40:00-06:00">
  OpenAM (the cause of the outage) has come back online and everything is operating normally.
