import Update from '@components/status/Update.astro';

The discover base maps are responding slow or returning errors for WMS and WMTS requests. Tiles previously cached seem to load, but nothing new is loading when panning/zooming or switching layers. We have contacted our support team to further investigate and are awaiting a resolution.
