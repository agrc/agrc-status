The TURN GPS network is having intermittent issues. We are meeting with Trimble to try to find a resolution.

<Update date="2023-10-03T09:24:53.000Z">
  After meeting with Trimble we've come to the conclusion that the machine resources are exhausted. More resources have
  been requested.
</Update>

<Update date="2023-10-03T19:24:53.000Z">
  More resources have been added and the system appears to have stabilized.
</Update>
