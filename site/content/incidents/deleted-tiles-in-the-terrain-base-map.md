Tiles outside of Salt Lake, Morgan and Weber counties were accidentally removed from the discover servers.

A suggested work-around would be to use the Lite base map.

We are working hard to generate new tiles. There's currently no ETA on when they will be completed.

All tiles in levels 0 through 16 have now been restored. Work continues on levels 17-19. {{< track "2018-12-21T12:15:00.000Z" >}}
