All AGRC web servers and GIS servers that are hosted in the Capitol Datacenter are currently inaccessible. All AGRC websites and the web api are not responding. A critical ticket has been submitted and we hope Capitol Hosting can resolve the issues quickly.

## Update

All of the services are turning green. We are working with Capitol Hosting to determine the cause. We will continue to monitor for issues. {{< track "2019-04-18T19:35:25.000Z" >}}
