The SGID is not accepting connections in a timely manner. This is affecting desktop GIS users trying to access SGID data as well as the searching and milepost queries on api.mapserv.utah.gov. Some web applications that have direct connections to the SGID will not function properly until this issue is resolved. Tickets and emails have been sent to the database group and we are awaiting their support.
