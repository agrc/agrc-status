Updates to the OpenAM agent done by Capitol Hosting have caused issues with the mapserv.utah.gov default website. Sites living off of mapserv.utah.gov, eg: mapserv.utah.gov/app, are affected by these changes. We are actively working with Capitol Hosting to resolve the issue. We will post an update at 11:00AM.
