Updates to the OpenAM agent done by Capitol Hosting have caused issues with the mapserv.utah.gov default website. Sites living off of mapserv.utah.gov, eg: mapserv.utah.gov/app, are affected by these changes. We are actively working with Capitol Hosting to resolve the issue. We will post an update at 11:00AM.

**Update** The OpenAM upgrade was rolled back and testing will continue at 9:00PM tonight. {{<track "2019-09-12T11:10:38.000Z">}}
