The milepost and reverse milepost endpoints are returning no values. The data source backing this data was unintentionally modified. We are working to restore the data. We will update this issue when the issue is resolved.

## Update

The data was restored. We will modify our internal scripts and open a dialog with UDOT to ensure this does not happen again. {{< track "2020-04-13T12:16:44.000Z" >}}
