The TURN GPS network is having intermittent issues. We are meeting with Trimble to try to find a resolution.

## Update

After meeting with Trimble we've come to the conclusion that the machine resources are exhausted. More resources have been requested. {{< track "2023-10-03T09:24:53.000Z" >}}

## Update 2

More resources have been added and the system appears to have stabilized. {{< track "2023-10-03T09:24:53.000Z" >}}
