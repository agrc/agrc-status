The discover base maps are responding slow or returning errors for WMS and WMTS requests. Tiles previously cached seem to load, but nothing new is loading when panning/zooming or switching layers. We have contacted our support team to further investigate and are awaiting a resolution.

## Update

Services have been restored by the vendor. {{< track "2019-09-05T08:00:00Z" >}}
