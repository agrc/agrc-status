The web api machine is not responding to requests and we are not able to connect to it at the moment due to some issues with the domain. Hosting has been notified and is working on resolving the connection issue.

**Update**: Hosting added the machine back into the domain and after a restart everything is operating normally. {{< track "2022-02-18T15:31:21.466Z" >}}
